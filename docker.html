     Docker is developed primarily for Linux, where it uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file 
system such as OverlayFS and others[25] to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual 
machines (VMs).[26] The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly[27] isolates a application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, 
user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting for memory and CPU.[28] Since version 0.9, Docker includes the libcontainer library as
 its own way to directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and systemd-nspawn.
