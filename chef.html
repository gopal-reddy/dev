  Chef continuously configures systems against your desired state<h2>
 <h4>As our environments grow in size and complexity, manual processes can become a barrier to deploying changes with confidence and consistency. Systems are missed during 
software updates or scheduled maintenance leading to unpredictable configuration drift across your estate. Unexpected and difficult to diagnose failures are uncovered late in 
the development cycle due to inconsistently configured environments between development and production. All this results in delayed releases, costly rollbacks, and too much
 time spent on unplanned work.
 Chef automates the process of managing configurations, ensuring that every system you’re responsible for is configured correctly and consistently. Because Chef applies
 updates dynamically, you can make conditional changes based on their running environment or hardware, ensuring that the same code that configures development can be used all the
 way through to production. Chef’s built-in “test & repair” behavior means that systems can update their configurations continuously, and Chef will only take action when machine
s diverge from their desired state. Chef makes your infrastructure configurations testable, portable, and auditable, giving your teams the freedom to focus on building
new innovations, rather than re-solving old problems.
