   Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for 
source-code management in software development,but it can be used to keep trackof changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision-control system, it is aimed 
at speed,data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
  <h2>Characteristics</h2>
Git's design is a synthesis of Torvalds's experience with Linux in maintaining a large distributed development project, along with his intimate knowledge of file system performance gained from the same project and the urgent need to produce a working system in short order. These influences led to the following implementation choices:[citation needed]

</h3>Strong support for non-linear development</h3>
Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history. In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.
<h3>Distributed development</h3>
Like Darcs, BitKeeper, Mercurial, SVK, Bazaar, and Monotone, Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.
<h3>Compatibility with existent systems and protocols</h3>
Repositories can be published via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), rsync (removed in Git 2.8.0[31]), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or Secure Shell (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. Subversion and svk repositories can be used directly with git-svn.
<h3>Efficient handling of large projects</h3>
Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable, and performance tests done by Mozilla[33] showed that it was an order of magnitude faster than some version-control systems; fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.[34]
